# Intro-to-Computer-Science-I
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the programming projects I completed during my **Computer Science I (COSC 236)** course at **Towson University**.  
The projects demonstrate my understanding of **fundamental programming concepts in Java**, including:

- Basic syntax and control structures  
- Methods and parameter passing  
- Object-oriented programming (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)  
- Arrays and ArrayLists  
- Recursion  
- File input/output (I/O)

The purpose of this repo is to showcase my early development as a computer science student and to track my progress as I grew more comfortable with programming.
